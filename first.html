<h1><center>INSPIRED BY LEGACY</center></h1>

<p>In the ruins of Gandhara lay a city like no other, what now is a forgotten, is a city that was once the pinnacle of artisanship. This city was not only built on the back of many artisans but also attracted and inspired flocks of craftsmen to learn and create new art forms as it was a hub for creativity. â€‹The local artists, stimulated by the personality of Buddha, took advantage of the contacts, motifs and technology from Greeks, Romans and Persians and developed such a unique art which gave Buddha an eternal life. The art of Taxila transgressed borders and inspired artisans from all over the world. Here is where the true craftsmanship of stone was cultivated. As a way to honor and bring the ancient city of Taxila back to life, our company vows to cultivate the exact same artistry that inspired many eons ago. We vow to inspire you and in turn be inspired by you!</p>
<h1>we are happy</h1>
